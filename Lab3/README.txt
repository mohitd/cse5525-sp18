Lab 3

Extension 2: we see a mostly linear alignment between those two waveforms. In other words, either one isn't stretched out: they're fairly the same length waveforms.

Commands:
python3 Lab3.py -- computes accuracy of both MFCCs and log spectrum on "b" dataset, trained on "a" dataset.

python3 extension1.py -- computes accuracy on human's recording, trained on the "a" dataset.
